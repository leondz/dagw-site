## Introduction

It’s hard to develop good tools for Danish NLP when no large and wide-coverage corpus is readily available. To address this, the Danish Gigaword project (DAGW) maintains a corpus for Danish with over a billion words. This is the homepage for the project. The general goals are to create a dataset that is 

 1. representative; 
 2. accessible; 
 3. a suitable basis for starting Danish NLP models.

The corpus is managed and communicated in English so that the world beyond Denmark can also use the resource.
