## Introduction

It’s hard to develop good tools processing Danish with computers when no large and wide-coverage dataset of Danish text is readily available. To address this, the Danish Gigaword Project (DAGW) maintains a corpus for Danish with over a billion words. This is the homepage for the project. The general goals are to create a dataset that is:

 1. representative; 
 2. accessible; 
 3. a suitable common starting point for Danish NLP models.

The corpus is managed and communicated in English so that the world beyond Denmark can also use the resource.

## Download

Danish Gigaword is available via the IT University of Copenhagen:
